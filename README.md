# Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition & Control System  
**Deep Learning (CNN) + Computer Vision (OpenCV) + Streamlit**


## Project Overview

This project implements a **Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition System** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **OpenCV**.  
It detects hand gestures through a live webcam feed and maps them to control actions - enabling **touchless human-computer interaction**.

The goal is to demonstrate deep learning-based gesture classification, model development, and real-time inference for HCI applications.


## Features

- Real-time gesture recognition using webcam input  
- CNN model trained on gesture dataset  
- Integrated with **Streamlit** for interactive UI  
- Low latency prediction pipeline using **OpenCV**  
- Scalable code structure — add more gestures anytime  
- Ready for automation (slides, media, mouse, etc.)
